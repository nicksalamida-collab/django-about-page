Setting up the Django development environment came with a few challenges, but I was able to overcome them step by step. One of the first issues I faced was that Django was not recognized after activating my virtual environment. This happened because Django had not been installed inside the venv. I solved this by installing Django with `pip install django` and verifying the installation with `pip show django`. Another challenge was syncing my local project with GitHub. At first, my push was rejected because the remote repository already had commits. To resolve this, I used `git pull --rebase origin main` before pushing again. I also encountered an error when trying to add a new remote, but I fixed it by updating the existing origin with `git remote set-url`. These small but important troubleshooting steps taught me to carefully read error messages and verify configurations one by one. Overall, I learned the importance of isolating environments, keeping dependencies managed in the virtual environment, and properly configuring Git for version control. Although there were several roadblocks, solving them improved my confidence in managing both Django and Git.
